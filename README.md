> 
> Tech Stack: Python, Tableau
>
> Resources: Historical weather data was obtained from both Kaggle and Japan Meteorological Agency.
>
> Result: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) =  16.019 days. This discrepancy may stem from the fact that cherry blossoms bloomed 15 days later in 2024 compared to 2023, highlighting the variability of weather patterns.
